# NEUROBEHAVIORAL STATUS EXAM {#sec-nse}

## Reason for Referral

<!-- Information to Include in Reason for Referral Section
• List name and position of referral source
• Reason the individual is to be evaluated—What questions are to be addressed?
• Concerns of parent, caregiver, teacher, or examinee (if applicable)
• Previous diagnoses, disabilities, or medical concerns -->

{{< var first_name >}} {{< var last_name >}} is a {{< var age >}}-year-old, {{< var handedness >}}right-handed research assistant with {{< var education >}} years of education, including a B.A. in Hustling from the University of Bed-Sty. {{< var he_she_cap >}} was referred in order to determine the nature and extent of neurocognitive sequelae emerging from a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The purpose of the current evaluation is {{< var dx1 >}}, {{< var dx2 >}}, and {{< var dx3 >}}. This report is based on a review of available medical records and information gathered across multiple days of evaluation. Treatment planning and plans for test accommodations were discussed with {{< var first_name >}} during the feedback visit on the final day of the examination.

## Background

<!-- **Information to Include in Background Information Section**
Provide pertinent information that has been obtained from all sources, including the referral source, family members, examinee, teachers, medical records, and so on. Do not include needless details or gossip. Following are examples of information that should be included:
• Current family dynamics (spouse, children, siblings, etc.) 
• Medical and psychiatric history
• Developmental history
• Educational history (note any special services)
• Employment history (for adults) 
• Previous therapeutic intervention 
• Current stressors
• Summary of past evaluations -->

The following information was obtained during an interview with {{< var patient >}} and from review of available medical records. {{< var first_name >}} has been doing well in {{< var his_her >}} classes since starting law school and has never failed. However, issues have begun to arise that {{< var he_she >}} has been unable to avoid, including being easily distracted, restlessness, constantly fidgeting, procrastination, and variable attention. {{< var he_she_cap >}} suspects having ADHD and has always struggled with aspects of it. {{< var first_name >}}'s mother tried to get {{< var his_her >}} evaluated and tested when {{< var he_she >}} was younger, but was never able to do so because {{< var his_her >}} school at the time did not agree that there were major concerns. {{< var he_she_cap >}} has noticed increasing difficulty initiating tasks, especially when it comes to writing long research papers, and has been procrastinating more and more. {{< var first_name >}} has read up on ADHD and believes {{< var he_she >}} may have it, but has been able to hide it from others, as {{< var he_she >}} has "gotten good at pretending to pay attention." {{< var he_she_cap >}} seeks further assessment and evaluation to identify any underlying neurocognitive factors influencing {{< var his_her >}} academic motivations and performance.

**Cognitive complaints**: sustained attention, working memory, and organization.

# RECOMMENDATIONS {#sec-recs}

## Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare

- {{< var first_name >}} should receive interventions to enhance concentration, manage anxiety, and improve emotional understanding. This includes social skills training, psychoeducational interventions for self-image improvement, and monitoring for signs of internalization or externalization of problems.

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** To develop strategies for improving executive functions and addressing self-esteem issues.

- **Occupational Therapy:** To enhance graphomotor skills for academic tasks and daily activities.

- **Cognitive Training:** Techniques to boost working memory and attention, along with strategies to improve focus.

- **Speech-Language Therapy:** Working with a speech-language pathologist can help improve memory skills, particularly for verbal material.

- **Psychoeducation:** To empower {{< var patient >}} with self-awareness and enable {{< var his_her >}} to advocate for {{< var his_her >}} needs in various settings.

- Additional support is recommended in areas like attentional function, processing speed, and cognitive efficiency. This can be achieved through occupational therapy, the use of organizational tools, and creating a distraction-free environment.

- Treatment options for ADHD should include behavioral techniques, stimulant medication consideration, environmental organization, and long-term perspective maintenance. Medical treatment discussion with a child and adolescent psychiatrist could be beneficial.

- Additional support is suggested in areas like auditory comprehension and complex figure copying. This can be accomplished through speech-language pathology and occupational therapy respectively. Use of visual aids and breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps can also be helpful.

## Recommendations for School

- **Accommodated Testing:** Extended time accommodations are recommended due to relative weakness in processing speed and academic fluency.

- **Calculator Use:** Please consider allowing {{< var patient >}} to utilize a calculator for class assignments and examinations as {{< var he_she >}} progresses in the mathematics curriculum.

- {{< var patient >}} should receive additional support in mathematics through:
  - Individual or small group tutoring.
  - Visual aids and hands-on activities.
  - Technology-based learning tools.
  - Real-life math scenarios practice.
  - Extra time for math-related tasks.

- Support within the educational setting, such as an individualized education plan (IEP) or 504 Plan, to address attentional/executive challenges. Academic accommodations should include extended time on tests, reduced copying from the board, or a note-taker to offset slower psychomotor speed and attentional challenges.

- **Adaptive Writing Tools:** Use of ergonomic pens or pencil grips for better control and fewer errors.

- **Graphomotor Exercises:** Drawing or tracing exercises for improved fine motor coordination.

- **Extra Time for Written Tasks:** Additional time for tasks requiring writing to compensate for slower graphomotor speed.

- **Technology Use:** Keyboard or voice-to-text software use to mitigate graphomotor weaknesses' effect on academic performance.

- Tutoring or teaching assistance is recommended for improving {{< var his_her >}} sentence level writing fluency and overall academic fluency in reading, math, and writing. 

- A supportive environment at home and school involving clear instructions, task breakdown into smaller steps, and praise for efforts and achievements.

## Recommendations for Home

- **Mnemonic Devices:** Use of mnemonic strategies like acronyms or visual images for memory retention.

- **Organizational Strategies:** Note-taking, list-making, and visual schedules can provide external memory support.

- **Task Simplification:** Break down complex information into smaller, manageable parts for effective processing and remembering.

- **Repeated Exposure and Practice:** Repeated exposure to material and additional practice are beneficial due to below-average learning efficiency.

- **Set Reminders:** Use calendars, alarms, written notes, and lists for task reminders.

- **Mindfulness Training:** Technique to ignore distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand, aiding in cognitive control.

## Recommendations for Follow-Up Evaluation

- A follow-up assessment in 12-18 months is suggested to measure progress and assess the interventions' impact, unless urgent concerns arise. Continuous monitoring and reassessment are vital to adjust support as {{< var first_name >}} develops and {{< var his_her >}} needs change.

## Test Selection Procedures

Neuropsychological tests are performance-based, and cognitive performance is summarized above. Cultural considerations were made in selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Test scores are reported in comparison to same-age and sex/gender peers, with labels (e.g., Below Average, Average, Above Average; [@guilmetteAmericanAcademyClinical2020]), intended to be descriptive, not diagnostic. Standardized scores provide important context, but do not alone lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.
