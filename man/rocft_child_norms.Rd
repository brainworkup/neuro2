\title{ROCFT Child Norms (Ages 6–15)}
\format{
A data frame with 10 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
\item{age}{Age in years (integer).}
\item{copy_m}{Mean raw score for the Copy trial.}
\item{copy_sd}{Standard deviation for the Copy trial raw score.}
\item{recall_m}{Mean raw score for the Delayed Recall trial.}
\item{recall_sd}{Standard deviation for the Delayed Recall trial raw score.}
}
}
\source{
Derived from commonly cited neuropsychological sources; missing ages
10 and 12 imputed for package use. Consult primary literature for specifics.

\description{
Normative data for the Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT) for children
aged 6 to 15. Includes means and standard deviations for both the Copy and
Delayed Recall trials. Ages 10 and 12 are imputed linearly from surrounding
ages. Ages 16–18 are intentionally excluded (use adult norms).
}
\details{
Imputation uses simple linear interpolation (\code{stats::approx}) between the nearest
available ages. Use this dataset to compute z/T/percentiles for raw Copy and
Delayed Recall scores in this age range.
