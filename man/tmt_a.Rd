\title{Compute TMT-A standardized scores (z, t, percentile)}
\usage{
tmt_a(age, raw_score)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{Numeric. Participant age in years (must be between 4 and 89).}

\item{raw_score}{Numeric. Raw completion time in seconds for TMT-A.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{age}: Input age.
\item \code{raw_score}: Input raw completion time.
\item \code{predicted_mean}: Normative mean completion time for that age.
\item \code{predicted_sd}: Normative standard deviation for that age.
\item \code{z_score}: Reversed z-score: (mean - raw) / sd.
\item \code{t_score}: Reversed t-score: 50 + 10 * z-score.
\item \code{percentile}: Percentile rank (pnorm(z) * 100).
}
}
\description{
This function calculates standardized scores for the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A)
using normative data from adults (Appendix 4M, Mitrushina et al.) and imputed
child norms for ages 4â€“15. Because TMT-A is timed (higher raw = slower), scores
are reversed so that larger raw times yield more negative z-scores, lower t-scores,
and lower percentile ranks.
