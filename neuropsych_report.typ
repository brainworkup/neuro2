== Attention/Executive
<sec-executive>
Ethan's score on Coding (speed of information processing) was High Average. Ethan's score on Attention Index (general attentional and executive functioning) was High Average. Ethan's score on Digit Span (attention span and auditory attention) was Average. Maintenance and resequencing of progressively lengthier sets of pictures in spatial working memory fell within the Average and ranked at the 37th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 37% of same-age peers from the general population.

Selective attention and attentional fluency on a cancellation task fell within the Average and ranked at the 37th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 37% of same-age peers from the general population.

Auditory attentional capacity, or how much information can be processed at once fell within the Average and ranked at the 37th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 37% of same-age peers from the general population.

A measure of both attentional capacity and working memory fell within the Average and ranked at the 37th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 37% of same-age peers from the general population.

Rate of test taking, perceptual speed, visual discrimination, and visual attention scanning (random) fell within the Average and ranked at the 37th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 37% of same-age peers from the general population.

Rate of test taking, perceptual speed, visual discrimination, and visual attention scanning (structured) fell within the Average and ranked at the 37th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 37% of same-age peers from the general population.

Registering, maintaining, and manipulating auditory information fell within the Low Average and ranked at the 16th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 16% of same-age peers from the general population.

Efficiency of psychomotor speed, visual scanning ability, and visual-motor coordination fell within the Low Average and ranked at the 9th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 9% of same-age peers from the general population.

Visual-perceptual decision-making speed fell within the Low Average and ranked at the 9th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 9% of same-age peers from the general population.

Performance on a measures that requires cognitive flexibility, divided attention, visual search, and the ability to shift cognitive sets between number and letter sequences fell within the Below Average range. Maintenance and resequencing of progressively lengthier number strings in working memory fell within the Below Average and ranked at the 2nd percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 2% of same-age peers from the general population.

Visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, and motor speed and coordination on Part A of the Trail Making Test fell within the Exceptionally Low range.
