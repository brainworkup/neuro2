= NEUROBEHAVIORAL STATUS EXAM
<neurobehavioral-status-exam>
== Reason for Referral
<reason-for-referral>
Ethan Smalls is a 18-year-old, rightright-handed research assistant with 12 years years of education, including a B.A. in Hustling from the University of Bed-Sty. He was referred in order to determine the nature and extent of neurocognitive sequelae emerging from a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The purpose of the current evaluation is ADHD, anxiety, and depression. This report is based on a review of available medical records and information gathered across multiple days of evaluation. Treatment planning and plans for test accommodations were discussed with Ethan during the feedback visit on the final day of the examination.

== Background/History
<backgroundhistory>
=== Developmental/Medical History
<developmentalmedical-history>
Ethan was born full-term with no reported complications during pregnancy or delivery. His early development included some notable features: bed-wetting beyond typical age (with no identified medical cause), difficulties with frustration tolerance when learning new physical skills, and early motor coordination issues described as appearing "a bit floppy when he ran or was active," which reportedly improved during his high school years.

His medical history includes mild asthma (more significant in childhood), an appendectomy, allergy to Mesquite trees, and vision impairment for which he was prescribed contacts but does not wear them. Ethan experienced a fever above 104Â° at age 13. He was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary school and prescribed medication, which he refused due to disliking "the feeling." He is currently unmedicated and has no history of psychological counseling or psychiatric evaluation. Ethan is right-handed for all activities and typically visits a physician approximately twice yearly, with his last medical visit approximately one year ago.

=== Behavioral/Emotional/Social
<behavioralemotionalsocial>
Ethan is described as having "a big heart," being "fun to be with," and "very social." He demonstrates leadership qualities in peer group interactions but exhibits significant behavioral challenges, including reactive anger when challenged or insulted and a history of fighting when provoked. According to reports, "Most of the time, it is not he who causes the issue, but he is quick to fight if challenged." He associates with peers who reportedly use illegal drugs and alcohol.

Behaviorally, Ethan exhibits overstimulation in play, a short attention span consistent with his ADHD diagnosis, and emotional withholding (difficulty expressing affection and feelings). His interests center around football, boxing, and video games, particularly online gaming with friends. There has been no recent decline in his participation in preferred activities.

=== Family History
<family-history>
Ethan currently resides with his father in an apartment, where he has lived for the past 1.5 years. His parents separated when he was an infant. His mother, NAME, is unemployed with some college education. His father, NAME, is a self-employed executive who completed 11th grade. Ethan has no siblings.

While reportedly closer to his father, Ethan "has a good relationship with mom too." The father serves as the primary disciplinarian with a "more strict" approach, while the mother maintains "more of a friend style relationship." Discipline techniques include grounding and suspension of preferred activities, though Ethan "tends to listen with an attitude." Family activities include sports, conversations, and trips, with English as the primary language spoken at home. He sees his grandparents only a "Few Times a Year."

Significant family health history includes the father's intermittent stress-related hypertension and the mother's "problem with alcohol." Notably, both parents had ADHD, with the mother having taken Ritalin during her school years, suggesting a strong genetic component to Ethan's own ADHD diagnosis.

=== Educational History
<educational-history>
Ethan is currently in 10th grade at Home School, having transitioned from NAME High School by choice in 2024. His academic performance has improved in the homeschool setting, where he now earns mostly B's with one A. His educational history includes grade retention in elementary school and consistently performing below grade level on academic testing.

He has demonstrated specific difficulties with mathematics, described as being unable to "comprehend complicated, long math problems" and having "a hard time retaining information." Ethan has been evaluated for special education annually since 5th grade and currently has an active Individualized Education Program (IEP) with an ADHD diagnosis. His homeschool curriculum includes adaptations such as "business math instead of algebra." His anticipated graduation is in 2027.

While the father reports satisfaction with the current educational arrangement, he expresses concern about the lack of opportunity for school sports participation, which he believes "would have been very good for him" and might have prevented Ethan from associating with "kids that were trouble and not athletes."

= RECOMMENDATIONS
<sec-recs>
== Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare
<recommendations-for-medicalhealthcare>
- Ethan should receive interventions to enhance concentration, manage anxiety, and improve emotional understanding. This includes social skills training, psychoeducational interventions for self-image improvement, and monitoring for signs of internalization or externalization of problems.

- #strong[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):] To develop strategies for improving executive functions and addressing self-esteem issues.

- #strong[Occupational Therapy:] To enhance graphomotor skills for academic tasks and daily activities.

- #strong[Cognitive Training:] Techniques to boost working memory and attention, along with strategies to improve focus.

- #strong[Speech-Language Therapy:] Working with a speech-language pathologist can help improve memory skills, particularly for verbal material.

- #strong[Psychoeducation:] To empower Ethan with self-awareness and enable his to advocate for his needs in various settings.

- Additional support is recommended in areas like attentional function, processing speed, and cognitive efficiency. This can be achieved through occupational therapy, the use of organizational tools, and creating a distraction-free environment.

- Treatment options for ADHD should include behavioral techniques, stimulant medication consideration, environmental organization, and long-term perspective maintenance. Medical treatment discussion with a child and adolescent psychiatrist could be beneficial.

- Additional support is suggested in areas like auditory comprehension and complex figure copying. This can be accomplished through speech-language pathology and occupational therapy respectively. Use of visual aids and breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps can also be helpful.

== Recommendations for School
<recommendations-for-school>
- #strong[Accommodated Testing:] Extended time accommodations are recommended due to relative weakness in processing speed and academic fluency.

- #strong[Calculator Use:] Please consider allowing Ethan to utilize a calculator for class assignments and examinations as he progresses in the mathematics curriculum.

- Ethan should receive additional support in mathematics through:

  - Individual or small group tutoring.
  - Visual aids and hands-on activities.
  - Technology-based learning tools.
  - Real-life math scenarios practice.
  - Extra time for math-related tasks.

- Support within the educational setting, such as an individualized education plan (IEP) or 504 Plan, to address attentional/executive challenges. Academic accommodations should include extended time on tests, reduced copying from the board, or a note-taker to offset slower psychomotor speed and attentional challenges.

- #strong[Adaptive Writing Tools:] Use of ergonomic pens or pencil grips for better control and fewer errors.

- #strong[Graphomotor Exercises:] Drawing or tracing exercises for improved fine motor coordination.

- #strong[Extra Time for Written Tasks:] Additional time for tasks requiring writing to compensate for slower graphomotor speed.

- #strong[Technology Use:] Keyboard or voice-to-text software use to mitigate graphomotor weaknesses' effect on academic performance.

- Tutoring or teaching assistance is recommended for improving his sentence level writing fluency and overall academic fluency in reading, math, and writing.

- A supportive environment at home and school involving clear instructions, task breakdown into smaller steps, and praise for efforts and achievements.

== Recommendations for Home
<recommendations-for-home>
- #strong[Mnemonic Devices:] Use of mnemonic strategies like acronyms or visual images for memory retention.

- #strong[Organizational Strategies:] Note-taking, list-making, and visual schedules can provide external memory support.

- #strong[Task Simplification:] Break down complex information into smaller, manageable parts for effective processing and remembering.

- #strong[Repeated Exposure and Practice:] Repeated exposure to material and additional practice are beneficial due to below-average learning efficiency.

- #strong[Set Reminders:] Use calendars, alarms, written notes, and lists for task reminders.

- #strong[Mindfulness Training:] Technique to ignore distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand, aiding in cognitive control.

== Recommendations for Follow-Up Evaluation
<recommendations-for-follow-up-evaluation>
- A follow-up assessment in 12-18 months is suggested to measure progress and assess the interventions' impact, unless urgent concerns arise. Continuous monitoring and reassessment are vital to adjust support as Ethan develops and his needs change.

It was a pleasure to work with Mr. Smalls. I am available to provide further information or clarification as needed.

Sincerely,

Thank you for considering this report in your evaluation of Mr. Smalls. I am available to provide further information or clarification as needed.

Respectfully submitted,

== Test Selection Procedures
<test-selection-procedures>
Neuropsychological tests are performance-based, and cognitive performance is summarized above. Cultural considerations were made in selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Test scores are reported in comparison to same-age and sex/gender peers, with labels (e.g., Below Average, Average, Above Average; (Guilmette et al., 2020)), intended to be descriptive, not diagnostic. Standardized scores provide important context, but do not alone lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.
