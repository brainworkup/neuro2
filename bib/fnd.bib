  abstract = {Patients with functional neurological disorders (FND)/conversion disorder commonly present to outpatient clinics. FND is now a `rule in' diagnosis based on neurological examination findings and semiological features. While neurologists may be more comfortable diagnosing patients with FND, there is only limited guidance as to how to conduct followup outpatient visits. Using clinical vignettes, we provide practical suggestions that may help guide clinical encounters including how to: (1) explore illness beliefs openly; (2) enquire longitudinally about predisposing vulnerabilities, acute precipitants and perpetuating factors that may be further elucidated over time; (3) facilitate psychotherapy engagement by actively listening for potentially unhelpful or maladaptive patterns of thoughts, behaviours, fears or psychosocial stressors that can be reflected back to the patient and (4) enquire about the fidelity of individual treatments and educate other providers who may be less familiar with FND. These suggestions, while important to individualise, provide a blueprint for follow-up FND clinical care.},

  abstract = {Functional neurological disorder (FND), previously regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion, is now a rule-in diagnosis with available treatments. This represents a major step toward destigmatizing the disorder, which was often doubted and deemed untreatable. FND is prevalent, generally affecting young and middle aged adults, and can cause severe disability in some individuals. An early diagnosis, with subsequent access to evidence based rehabilitative and/or psychological treatments, can promote recovery---albeit not all patients respond to currently available treatments. This review presents the latest advances in the use of validated rule-in examination signs to guide diagnosis, and the range of therapeutic approaches available to care for patients with FND. The article focuses on the two most frequently identified subtypes of FND: motor (weakness and/or movement disorders) and seizure type symptoms. Twenty two studies on motor and 27 studies on seizure type symptoms report high specificities of clinical signs (64-100\%), and individual signs are reviewed. Rehabilitative interventions (physical and occupational therapy) are treatments of choice for functional motor symptoms, while psychotherapy is an emerging evidence based treatment across FND subtypes. The literature to date highlights heterogeneity in responses to treatment, underscoring that more research is needed to individualize treatments and develop novel interventions.

  abstract = {Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is a common and disabling condition seen by nearly every clinician in nearly every clinical setting. There are multiple subtypes with seizure and motor/movement being the most common. There is high health care utilization and costs, and many patients have a chronic course and remain disabled. It is clear from research over the past two decades that abnormalities in brain network activity are implicated in the pathophysiology of FND. Diagnosis requires positive criteria and knowing how to obtain a good history and avoid common pitfalls. There are evidence-based treatments and expert consensus recommendations. A multidisciplinary team knowledgeable about the disorder is important for the best outcomes but there is much more work to be done. This review will focus on the practical aspects of diagnosing and managing FND.},

  abstract = {Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterized by neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a structural neurological cause. Among the different aetiological models that have been proposed for FND, of note is the Bayesian predictive coding model, which posits that perception relies on top-down cortical predictions (priors) to infer the source of incoming sensory information. This model can also apply to non-pathological experiences, such as placebo and nocebo effects, wherein sensory information is shaped by prior expectations and learning. To date, most studies of the relationship between placebo and nocebo effects and FND have focused on the use of placebos for diagnosis and treatment of FND. Here, we propose that this relationship might go beyond diagnosis and therapy. We develop a framework in which shared cognitive, personality and neuroanatomical factors justify the consideration of a deeper link between FND and placebo and nocebo effects. This new perspective might offer guidance for clarification of the pathogenesis of FND and for the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

Iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND is significant, however, and has been around for centuries. Despite advances in our understanding around the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of FND, many aspects of such harm continue to persist. Avoidance of iatrogenic harm has been highlighted by clinicians as one of the most important therapeutic considerations in FND; however, the sources and range of potential harms, or indeed ways to mitigate them, have not previously been summarized.             Using a combination of clinical and research experience and scoping review methodology, this review aims to describe the main sources of iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND, including harm from misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and treatment, direct harm from professional interactions, other stigma-related harms, harm related to diagnostic overshadowing and over-diagnosis of FND. We also describe some potential ways to address and prevent such harms, such as ways to reduce misdiagnosis with a focus on rule in signs, optimizing teaching and communication, ensuring parity of FND with other medical conditions and continued integration of patient and professional organizations.},

Methods: We searched four relevant databases from inception to December 2023, using search terms relevant to FND and stigma themes. We employed the method of synthesis by ``aggregation and configuration'' to synthesise and analyse the data into emergent themes. Results: We found 127 studies, spanning 148 countries, involving 18,886 participants. Of these, 4889 were patients, 13,123 were healthcare professionals, and 526 were caregivers. Quantitatively, stigma has been mainly studied in patients with functional seizures, and was higher than patients with epilepsy in three studies. Stigma experienced by patients is associated with poorer quality of life and caregiver burden. We found 10 themes and 29 subthemes revealing stigma as a systemic process, with intrapersonal, interpersonal and structural aspects. Few studies examined the perspective of caregivers, the public or online community. We identified six antistigma interventions. Conclusion: Stigma in FND is a layered process, and affects patient quality of life and provision of care. Stigma needs to be addressed from the top structures, at governmental level, so that appropriate care pathways can be created, giving patients with FND parity of esteem with other medical conditions.},

The efficacy of physiotherapy for motor rehabilitation of these patients has been widely studied. The aim of this review is to analyse the available evidence on the effects of physiotherapy on motor symptoms, activity (gait, mobility, balance), perceived health, quality of life, and the cognitive/emotional state of patients with FMD. Methods: This review follows the PRISMA recommendations. Four electronic databases were searched for relevant articles. Our review included randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of a specialised physiotherapy intervention alone or in combination with other therapies as part of a multidisciplinary approach, with results compared against standard physiotherapy. Results: We reviewed 4 studies, including a total of 188 patients. We gathered data on the study population, outcome measures, protocols, and results. According to the Oxford quality scoring system, 3 studies had moderate methodological quality (3---4/5) and the remaining study presented poor methodological quality ({$<$} 3). Conclusions: Physiotherapy improves motor symptoms, activity, perceived health, and quality of life in patients with FMD. \copyright{} 2022 Sociedad Espan\texttildelow ola de Neurolog\textasciiacute\i a.
