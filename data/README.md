# Data Directory

This directory contains processed neuropsychological data files generated by the package.

The directory is intentionally kept empty in the package source, as data files will be generated here when the package functions are run.

Files that may appear in this directory during package usage include:
- CSV files with processed test results
- Parquet files for efficient data storage
- Feather files for cross-language compatibility
