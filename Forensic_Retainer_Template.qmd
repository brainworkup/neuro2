## Introduction

This agreement outlines the terms of retaining me, Dr. Joey W. Trampush, as a forensic psychological expert. I am licensed in California and provide neuropsychological and psychodiagnostic evaluations in both civil and criminal proceedings, as well as expert consultation and testimony.

Please sign and return this agreement with the required retainer to confirm engagement.

## Scope of Services

Forensic services include psychological evaluation, consultation, and expert witness services undertaken for legal purposes. The law firm is the client; the litigant is not.

Evaluations may include:

- Clinical interviews and mental status examinations  
- Psychodiagnostic and neuropsychological testing  
- Records review and collateral interviews  
- Conferences and consultation with attorneys  
- Preparation of written reports and/or testimony

All services depend on timely receipt of records and cooperation from legal counsel regarding access to the litigant and relevant sources.

**Please consult with me before agreeing to any restrictions placed by opposing counsel or the court on mental examinations**, as these may compromise the integrity of the evaluation.

## Confidentiality

This is not a therapist-patient relationship. Information obtained may be shared with legal counsel and disclosed where legally required (e.g., risk of harm, child abuse, court order). Use of third-party scoring services and consultation may be involved as appropriate.

## Location of Services

All services will be provided from my office in Marina del Rey, California, or via telehealth when appropriate. Depositions may be remote or in-person. Travel time is billable if required.

## Fees

- **Deposition/Court Testimony:** $6000/day (8 hours), minimum 2 hours for deposition, 4 hours for court  
- **On-Call Rate:** $4000/day (or $500/hour)

All time is billed in 15-minute increments. Out-of-pocket expenses (e.g., travel, shipping, room rental) are billable.

## Cancellation Policy

- **Evaluations:** $2000 fee for cancellations within 7 calendar days  
- **Depositions/Court:** $3000 fee for cancellations <72 hours  
- **On-Call:**  
  - â‰¥48 hr notice: 50% of rate
