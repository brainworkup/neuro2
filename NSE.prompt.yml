      You are a board-certified clinical neuropsychologist who helps with data
      analysis and report writing.

    content: >-
      You are a highly skilled neuropsychologist tasked with summarizing a
      Neurobehavioral Status Exam (NSE) transcript for a neuropsychological
      report. Your goal is to create a professional, concise, and informative
      summary that captures the key aspects of the patient's condition and
      history.


      Here is the NSE transcript you need to analyze:


      <nse_transcript>

      {{FILE}}

      </nse_transcript>


      Before you begin your analysis, please read through the entire transcript
      to familiarize yourself with all the information provided. Note that the
      information may not always be presented in a linear fashion, so be
      prepared to integrate details from various parts of the transcript into
      the appropriate sections of your summary.


      As you work through the transcript, you will use the Chain of Density
      (CoD) model to continuously update and refine your understanding. This
      means you should:

      1. Start with a brief initial interpretation for each section.

      2. Progressively add more detail and nuance to your analysis.

      3. Incorporate information from previously analyzed sections to assist in
      interpretation.

      4. Continuously revise and update your summary as you encounter new
      information.


      Please organize your analysis and final summary into the following
      sections:


      1. Reason for Referral

      2. Background/History
         a. Developmental/Medical History
         b. Behavioral/Emotional/Social
         c. Family History
         d. Educational History

      For each section, wrap your analysis inside <cod_analysis> tags in your
      thinking block. In each <cod_analysis> section:

      - Quote relevant parts of the transcript.

      - List key points, numbering them.

      - Note any inconsistencies or gaps in information.

      - Show your thought process and interpretation of the information.


      After completing your analysis for all sections, provide a final summary
      in Markdown format outside of the thinking block.


      Guidelines for your summary:

      - Write 1-2 pages in total

      - Focus on information directly relevant to the chief complaint and reason
      for referral

      - Do not make assumptions without empirical information

      - Maintain a positive but neutral and professional tone

      - Translate assessment results into practical daily living implications
      (e.g., school, home, work, social)

      - Interpret findings in terms of everyday functioning

      - Emphasize how ratings relate to real-world settings

      - Use professional clinical tone and concise language

      - Ensure grammatical correctness

      - Write in the third-person voice and past tense


      After completing your initial summary, please review the entire document
      one last time to ensure that all relevant information has been
      incorporated, regardless of where it appeared in the original transcript.


      Here's an example of how your output should be structured:


      <cod_analysis>

      [Your detailed analysis of the "Reason for Referral" section]

      </cod_analysis>


      <cod_analysis>

      [Your detailed analysis of the "Developmental/Medical History" section]

      </cod_analysis>


      [Continue with analysis sections for each part of the Background/History]


      ```markdown

      # Neurobehavioral Status Exam (NSE) Summary


      ## Reason for Referral


      [Your concise summary of the reason for referral]


      ## Background/History


      ### Developmental/Medical History


      [Your concise summary of the developmental and medical history]


      ### Behavioral/Emotional/Social

      ### Family History


      [Your concise summary of relevant family history]


      ### Educational History


      [Your concise summary of the patient's educational history]

      ```


      Please proceed with your analysis and summary of the NSE transcript. Your
      final output should consist only of the Markdown summary and should not
      duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.

      *Isabella**: Okay, so I think it would make more sense to start from the
      first one.

      *02:40-02:43*


      **Isabella**: So September 29th, 2021.

      *02:43-02:46*


      **Isabella**: is when I had a sports-related concussion.

      *02:47-02:50*


      **Isabella**: I used to be a competitive swimmer.

      *02:50-02:52*


      **Isabella**: So, yeah, so I had an athletics-related concussion then.

      *02:53-02:56*


      **Isabella**: And so, basically, I didn't really know too much about
      concussions at the time, so I didn't really take it too seriously.

      *02:57-03:03*


      **Isabella**: I just, like, hit my head super hard on the wall when I was,
      like, racing.

      *03:03-03:07*


      **Joey**: Oh.

      *03:06-03:08*


      **Isabella**: Yeah, but I didn't pass out or anything like that. So I just
      didn't think it was super big deal.

      *03:09-03:14*


      **Isabella**: However, in like the coming weeks and things like that, I
      would notice that my balance would be horrible.

      *03:15-03:19*


      **Isabella**: Like at school, I would just like almost fall off the stairs
      or something like that.

      *03:19-03:22*


      **Isabella**: So eventually I went to like my school trainer and he told
      me that I definitely like probably got concussed at the time and.

      *03:22-03:31*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *03:23-03:25*


      **Joey**: Thank you.

      *03:25-03:25*


      **Joey**: Thank you.

      *03:29-03:49*


      **Isabella**: But he told me to just like take it easy a little bit and
      just like I could just take some time off of swimming, I believe.

      *03:31-03:39*


      **Isabella**: And I so I took a couple of days off of swimming, but I
      ended up going back to swim because I just didn't feel like too much was
      wrong with me at the time.

      *03:39-03:46*


      **Isabella**: And then I went back to swimming and then a month later I
      was driving and then I passed out while driving.

      *03:48-03:53*


      **Joey**: While you were driving?

      *03:54-03:55*


      **Isabella**: Yeah, I was the one driving, but thankfully I was going
      super, super slow.

      *03:55-03:59*


      **Isabella**: So this was October 27th, 2021.

      *04:00-04:03*


      **Isabella**: This was...

      *04:01-04:01*


      **Isabella**: So a month later.

      *04:04-04:05*


      **Joey**: And so you were out, so were you 16, 17?

      *04:05-04:09*


      **Isabella**: Let me calculate my age really quickly.

      *04:11-04:12*


      **Isabella**: This is 16, I believe.

      *04:15-04:20*


      **Joey**: And how long have you had your lessons?

      *04:20-04:22*


      **Isabella**: 16, 16.

      *04:21-04:21*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *04:31-04:31*


      **Joey**: And so what happened?

      *04:32-04:35*


      **Joey**: Do you have recollection of it?

      *04:35-04:38*


      **Joey**: Wow.

      *05:02-05:03*


      **Isabella**: And then I think I just remember, yeah, I don't really
      remember how that came about, if I'm being really honest with you.

      *05:02-05:11*


      **Isabella**: And then by the time I woke up, I remember like, she had
      already got the car in front of me had already gotten out of her car and
      was like by my window already.

      *05:13-05:21*


      **Joey**: So did you lose consciousness for a minute or two, do you think?

      *05:22-05:26*


      **Joey**: What was the last thing you remember before that happened?

      *05:33-05:37*


      **Joey**: And then all of a sudden you kind of wake up and you realize
      something happened and this person's out your window.

      *05:41-05:51*


      **Joey**: Do you, and that was, you said two months later, about two
      months later?

      *06:03-06:08*


      **Isabella**: One month later. This is October 27, 2021.

      *06:05-06:11*


      **Joey**: How were you feeling that day?

      *06:14-06:16*


      **Joey**: Do you remember anything about the day that stands out?

      *06:16-06:20*


      **Joey**: Or the couple days before that?

      *06:20-06:21*


      **Joey**: Were you feeling sick?

      *06:21-06:23*


      **Joey**: Were you feeling...

      *06:23-06:27*


      **Joey**: Yeah.

      *06:34-06:34*


      **Joey**: Yeah.

      *06:35-06:35*


      **Joey**: No, I was a football player, and then I actually used to work,
      trained with the New York Jets doing concussion testing.

      *06:41-06:48*


      **Joey**: So I know exactly what you're talking about.

      *06:49-06:51*


      **Joey**: Luckily, it's being acknowledged and taken more seriously, I
      think, more now than it ever was in the past.

      *06:53-07:00*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *06:56-06:56*


      **Joey**: But athletes are tough.

      *07:01-07:02*


      **Joey**: Like, you're tough.

      *07:02-07:03*


      **Joey**: You're always told, like, play through the pain and all that
      stuff.

      *07:04-07:07*


      **Joey**: So it's like a mixed message that you're getting.

      *07:07-07:11*


      **Isabella**: Exactly.

      *07:08-07:08*


      **Isabella**: Right.

      *07:12-07:13*


      **Isabella**: And at the time I was trying to get like recruited for
      college for swimming.

      *07:13-07:16*


      **Joey**: Yeah.

      *07:15-07:15*


      **Isabella**: So I was like taking it pretty seriously.

      *07:16-07:17*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *07:17-07:18*


      **Isabella**: And I probably looking back, I probably should have taken
      more time off than I did.

      *07:18-07:22*


      **Isabella**: I only took like a couple of days off or something like
      that.

      *07:22-07:24*


      **Isabella**: Obviously, it's a while ago, but yeah.

      *07:25-07:28*


      **Isabella**: I think I should have taken it a lot more serious than I
      did.

      *07:28-07:30*


      **Isabella**: And then I was still trying to do school normally.

      *07:31-07:33*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *07:32-07:33*


      **Isabella**: I just didn't really take any days off.

      *07:34-07:35*


      **Joey**: So you didn't take any time off school, you didn't take any time
      off of training and practice after the first one?

      *07:35-07:43*


      **Isabella**: Like after the.

      *07:36-07:38*


      **Isabella**: I think I took.

      *07:42-07:43*


      **Isabella**: I think after the first one, I might have taken like a
      couple days off.

      *07:43-07:46*


      **Isabella**: But this is after the trainer told me to take a couple days
      off, like two weeks after the concussion even happened.

      *07:47-07:51*


      **Joey**: Were you like sensitive to light and your environment and that
      sort of thing?

      *08:05-08:12*


      **Isabella**: I think so.

      *08:13-08:14*


      **Isabella**: This was like four years ago, so I'm not super clear on
      that.

      *08:15-08:18*


      **Isabella**: But I do think that what made me go to the school trainer in
      the first place was that I lost my balance on the stairs multiple times.

      *08:19-08:26*


      **Joey**: Did you ever fall?

      *08:24-08:27*


      **Joey**: Did you ever fall?

      *08:28-08:32*


      **Isabella**: So, yeah, I think I tripped on the stairs, actually, and I
      never trip on the stairs.

      *08:29-08:32*


      **Isabella**: Okay.

      *08:34-08:34*


      **Joey**: Okay, so...

      *08:35-08:36*


      **Joey**: So after when you after the, the the car accident, when you
      passed out did you go to the hospital?

      *08:58-09:04*


      **Isabella**: No, I literally went home.

      *09:04-09:08*


      **Isabella**: And then we the conclusion we came to is that I need to
      rest, I need to take a couple days off of school, and then I need to not
      drive.

      *09:08-09:14*


      **Isabella**: I think I did. Let me. I think we did see a doctor because
      we were really concerned.

      *09:16-09:23*


      **Joey**: Did you go see your doctor?

      *09:17-09:19*


      **Joey**: You didn't do anything?

      *09:19-09:20*


      **Isabella**: This is why I sent you all the like documentation because
      it's been so long that I don't exactly remember everything.

      *09:24-09:30*


      **Joey**: So, without a minute, the Seattle Children's notes.

      *09:30-09:33*


      **Isabella**: It definitely is Seattle Children's. I've just been going to
      Seattle Children's like this whole time. Let me see. October.

      *09:33-09:39*


      **Isabella**: October 2021.

      *09:43-09:45*


      **Isabella**: Give me one second.

      *09:50-09:51*


      **Isabella**: Oh, I think that I did go to the hospital.

      *09:58-10:02*


      **Joey**: So it looks like on the November 5th, you went to the emergency
      room.

      *10:17-10:22*


      **Isabella**: Yeah, but that was because that day I had a car accident.

      *10:22-10:25*


      **Joey**: Oh, so that was even, okay, yeah, I see the date, okay.

      *10:25-10:28*


      **Isabella**: So yeah, so it doesn't look like I went to I don't think so.

      *10:25-10:37*


      **Isabella**: November, October.

      *10:38-10:39*


      **Isabella**: Oh, I guess I actually know I did October 28th emergency
      department.

      *10:40-10:44*


      **Isabella**: I did.

      *10:46-10:46*


      **Isabella**: Yeah, I think the next day, I think I was like really
      rattled.

      *10:49-10:52*


      **Isabella**: I went home, I went to bed, and then the next day my parents
      were kind of like, "Oh, we need to get this checked out because you don't
      just like pass out at the wheel." So I do

      have my doctor's like emergency department report from the next day.

      *10:52-11:07*


      **Joey**: October 28th or 18th?

      *11:15-11:18*


      **Joey**: I see a note from 11-18-21.

      *11:25-11:27*


      **Isabella**: Maybe I didn't download this one. I can send this to you
      right now.

      *11:29-11:32*


      **Joey**: It's okay.

      *11:32-11:33*


      **Joey**: You've said more than enough.

      *11:33-11:34*


      **Isabella**: OK. But yes, I did. OK, sorry to answer to answer your
      question, I did go to the emergency department the next day.

      *11:37-11:42*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *11:42-11:43*


      **Isabella**: Yeah.

      *11:43-11:44*


      **Isabella**: Um, so essentially they didn't find anything at the
      emergency department.

      *11:45-11:50*


      **Isabella**: They just said that I shouldn't swim and that like, they
      just said I need to like take an actual break.

      *11:51-11:56*


      **Isabella**: that I should just not drive for the foreseeable like bit
      because it's concerning that I would pass out so thereby it brings us to
      the next accident so basically I had one

      of my friends drive me to and from school and so this is the next accident
      was a week later November 5th 2021 it was like a car like pileup accident
      and we were the last car

      some of my classmates were the car in front of us.

      *11:59-13:46*


      **Joey**: Thank you.

      *12:07-12:18*


      **Joey**: So that's very unfortunate.

      *12:37-12:42*


      **Joey**: It's very ironic that you're having somebody drive you and then
      they got into an accident because you were afraid of getting into an
      accident.

      *12:46-12:54*


      **Joey**: I don't mean to laugh, but that's, I mean, that's crazy.

      *12:54-12:56*


      **Joey**: Yeah, I bet.

      *13:00-13:01*


      **Joey**: Can you explain that in a little bit more detail?

      *13:20-13:23*


      **Joey**: What do you mean by that?

      *13:23-13:24*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *13:30-13:31*


      **Isabella**: So, cause we were all on the way to school.

      *13:46-13:48*


      **Isabella**: So they ended up, we all drove to school in their car
      together.

      *13:49-13:52*


      **Isabella**: Cause the car I was in was totaled.

      *13:52-13:54*


      **Joey**: That was that bad?

      *13:53-13:56*


      **Isabella**: So the police that, that, yeah, it was like the airbag
      deployed and everything.

      *13:54-13:59*


      **Isabella**: And, um, yeah, the car was totaled and then the car in front
      of us could still drive.

      *14:00-14:03*


      **Isabella**: So we went with my classmates and, I think I was feeling
      super lightheaded and brain fog at that point.

      *14:03-14:50*


      **Joey**: Oh wow.

      *14:23-14:26*


      **Isabella**: But I still wasn't really processing that well what was
      going on.

      *14:51-14:55*


      **Isabella**: Immediately, they just do an x-ray, send me to the
      orthopedics the next day, everything like that.

      *14:55-14:59*


      **Isabella**: But essentially, in the coming week was when I realized a
      lot of my symptoms were getting super bad.

      *15:00-15:05*


      **Isabella**: So I'm not really like, I don't usually take naps.

      *15:06-15:08*


      **Isabella**: And I think at that point, I was taking a five-hour nap
      every single day.

      *15:08-15:11*


      **Isabella**: And I couldn't really sleep at night very well.

      *15:12-15:15*


      **Isabella**: I couldn't have deep sleep.

      *15:15-15:16*


      **Isabella**: My head was really hurting.

      *15:17-15:18*


      **Isabella**: And like I was getting a lot of like brain fog,
      lightheadedness, and I kept having like ringing in my ears.

      *15:19-15:24*


      **Isabella**: And then I think I was also because I knew that I would like
      fall behind and everything like that.

      *15:27-16:45*


      **Joey**: And that was all, those were all like kind of new onset symptoms
      from the third incident.

      *15:27-15:34*


      **Joey**: For how long do so that's still problem.

      *16:00-16:03*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *16:06-16:08*


      **Joey**: Right.

      *16:37-16:39*


      **Isabella**: And I was super concerned about that.

      *16:45-16:46*


      **Isabella**: And yeah, I think like in the coming weeks, a lot more
      symptoms developed.

      *16:48-16:52*


      **Joey**: Okay.

      *16:52-16:53*


      **Isabella**: Obviously my dominant hand like was broken too.

      *16:52-16:55*


      **Isabella**: So I couldn't really write.

      *16:55-16:56*


      **Isabella**: and I couldn't do anything.

      *16:56-16:57*


      **Isabella**: So that made me take a break, if I'm being honest.

      *16:58-17:00*


      **Isabella**: My dominant hand not being able to write made me take a
      break and stay at home and actually rest.

      *17:00-17:04*


      **Isabella**: But I was resting an abnormal amount.

      *17:05-17:07*


      **Isabella**: I think I caught myself unable to...

      *17:08-17:11*


      **Isabella**: It's like every time my head would hurt, I would wanna take
      a nap.

      *17:12-17:14*


      **Isabella**: Then every time I'd take a nap, I couldn't wake up.

      *17:15-17:16*


      **Isabella**: And then every time I had to go to sleep at night, I
      couldn't fully go to sleep well either.

      *17:17-17:20*


      **Isabella**: So it was kind of just like a cycle.

      *17:21-17:23*


      **Isabella**: And then slowly but surely, I went to quite a few
      neurologists and different doctors and concussion rehab places.

      *17:24-17:35*


      **Isabella**: And I did biofeedback. I went to a chiropractor. I tried a
      billion different things.

      *17:35-17:40*


      **Joey**: Thank you.

      *17:38-17:41*


      **Isabella**: And eventually, I would say, I felt like at least that it
      took a while, but by the time it was next year, It's easier and easier.

      *17:40-18:53*


      **Joey**: Thank you.

      *17:48-17:49*


      **Joey**: Yeah, I mean, that's like, you had, you know, a mild to moderate
      TBI traumatic brain injury.

      *18:10-18:20*


      **Joey**: Those are very real and very challenging symptoms and people
      call it post-concussive syndrome and all that.

      *18:22-18:33*


      **Joey**: But this is like – these are – There's a lot here that you had
      to deal with and that because you know they probably told you many times
      like after you get like a first

      concussion then the threshold for getting a second one and if they're
      going to it's much lower yeah it's easier.

      *18:36-18:54*


      **Isabella**: Yeah, yeah.

      *18:54-18:55*


      **Isabella**: So I feel like it also has to do with the fact that these
      were like back to back.
