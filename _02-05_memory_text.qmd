Biggie's learning and memory abilities were assessed using multiple measures, including the California Verbal Learning Test-3 Brief (CVLT3-Brief) for verbal memory and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT) for visual memory.

On the CVLT3-Brief, Biggie demonstrated Average verbal learning and memory abilities. His immediate recall was in the Average range (Standard Score = 102, 55th percentile), indicating adequate encoding and initial learning of verbal information. His short-delay free recall was also in the Average range (Standard Score = 104, 61st percentile), suggesting intact short-term retention of verbal information. His long-delay free recall was in the Average range (Standard Score = 105, 63rd percentile), indicating adequate consolidation and retrieval of verbal information after a delay. His recognition discrimination was in the High Average range (Standard Score = 112, 79th percentile), suggesting that his recognition memory is somewhat stronger than his free recall abilities, though both are within normal limits.

Analysis of Biggie's learning curve on the CVLT3-Brief revealed a normal learning slope, with appropriate improvement across learning trials. His retention rate from immediate to delayed recall was 90%, which is within normal limits and suggests minimal loss of information over time. He made few intrusion errors (Standard Score = 108, 70th percentile) and few repetition errors (Standard Score = 106, 66th percentile), indicating good response monitoring and inhibition. His semantic clustering was in the Average range (Standard Score = 100, 50th percentile), suggesting adequate use of semantic organization strategies to facilitate learning and recall.

On the ROCFT, Biggie demonstrated Average visual memory abilities. His copy score was in the Average range (Standard Score = 104, 61st percentile), indicating adequate visuospatial construction abilities. His immediate recall was in the Average range (Standard Score = 102, 55th percentile), suggesting adequate encoding and short-term retention of visual information. His delayed recall was also in the Average range (Standard Score = 103, 58th percentile), indicating adequate consolidation and retrieval of visual information after a delay. His retention rate from immediate to delayed recall was 95%, which is within normal limits and suggests minimal loss of visual information over time.

On the memory subtests of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB), Biggie demonstrated Average performance. His NAB Memory Index was in the Average range (Standard Score = 102, 55th percentile). He performed in the Average range on measures of list learning (Standard Score = 100, 50th percentile), story memory (Standard Score = 104, 61st percentile), shape learning (Standard Score = 101, 53rd percentile), and daily living memory (Standard Score = 103, 58th percentile). His immediate and delayed recall were consistent across these subtests, suggesting intact memory consolidation processes.

Overall, Biggie demonstrates intact learning and memory abilities across both verbal and visual domains. His encoding, storage, and retrieval processes are all functioning within normal limits. There is no evidence of significant memory impairment that would impact his daily functioning or decision-making capacity.
