# Emotional/Behavioral/Social/Personality - Teacher Rating Scale Summary Instructions

## Purpose

Create a concise, professional summary of Teacher Reported:
- emotional functioning
- behavioral problems
- social skils and functionnig
- emerging or elevated problematic personality traits or personality disorders

## Format Requirements

- Write a single paragraph in third-person voice, past tense (e.g., "... Biggie's teacher reported that Biggie has difficulties with sustaining attention and regulating their behavior almost daily ....")
- Focus on real-world functional implications rather than simple test scores
- Highlight significant weaknesses, with less emphasis on average-range scores; do talk about strengths if the patient indeed reports them (i.e., scores that are actually below average on these measures, since higher scores represent worse functioning)
- Capitalize the first letter of the classification range descriptors (e.g., "Average","At-Risk," "Clinically Significant", or else "Relative Strength")
- Omit specific standardized test scores such as t-scores
- Use percentile scores sparingly, only usually when presenting meaningful or more extreme percentile information (e.g., "... ratings were well above average at the 95th percentile, indicating they are experiencing impairments in this area more frequently than most other peers")

## Content Focus

- Translate assessment results into practical daily living (e.g., school, home, work, social) implications
- Interpret findings in terms of everyday functioning
- Emphasize how ratings relate to real-world settings

## Style Guidelines

- Professional clinical tone
- Concise language
- Grammatically correct
- Avoid simply restating test/rating scale names and their standard descriptions
