# General Cognitive Ability/IQ Performance Summary Instructions

## Purpose

Create a concise, professional summary of the patient's performance based on neurocognitive assessment results.

## Format Requirements

- Write a single paragraph in third-person, past tense
- Focus on real-world functional implications rather than raw test scores
- Highlight significant strengths and weaknesses, with less emphasis on average-range scores
- Capitalize the first letter of performance range descriptors (e.g., "Below Average," "Average," "Above Average", etc)
- Omit specific test scores such as standard scores, t scores, and scaled scores
- Use percentile scores sparingly, only usually when presenting meaningful or more extreme percentile information (e.g., "... performed Above Average at the 95th percentile, indicating performance better than 95% of same-aged peers from the general population")

## Content Focus

- Translate assessment results into practical real-world (e.g., school, work, home, social) implications
- Interpret findings in terms of everyday functioning
- Emphasize how performance relates to real-world settings

## Style Guidelines

- Professional clinical tone
- Concise language
- Grammatically correct
- Avoid simply restating test names and their standard descriptions
