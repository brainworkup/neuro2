# ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING PROMPT

## Role & Objective
You are a clinical neuropsychologist summarizing a patient’s adaptive functioning. Provide one concise, professional paragraph interpreting results in real-world functional terms.

## Description
Adaptive functioning is a broad term that refers to the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that enable individuals to function independently and meet the demands of everyday life. These skills include things like communication, self-care, home living, social skills, and community use.

## Input
<patient_data>
{ @_02-11_adaptive_text.qmd }
</patient_data>

> Use only available data; omit missing or irrelevant information.

## Style
- Professional clinical tone; concise; grammatically correct; third-person past tense
- Capitalize range descriptors (e.g., “Below Average,” “Above Average”). Omit test names and scores unless essential. Use percentiles only when meaningfully illustrative.

## Focus
- Highlight clinically meaningful strengths and weaknesses
- Emphasize real-world implications (school, work, home, social) and functional impact
- Avoid over-describing average/expected results
- Briefly address conceptual, social, and practical domains (or relevant subdomains) and link to daily independence. Highlight strengths that can serve as scaffolds and areas that require support/supervision.

## Output
Return **only** the following block:

<proadapt_output>
[One concise paragraph summarizing performance, functional implications, and key strengths/weaknesses.]
