I hold multiple advanced degrees in clinical neuropsychology, including two master's degrees and a Ph.D., and have completed an APA-accredited internship in pediatric neuropsychology and a postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric genetics. I am licensed as a psychologist in California and New York, and have held various academic positions, including Director of the Laboratory of Cognitive Genomics, Assistant Investigator of Psychiatric Neuroscience, and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry.

Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Behavioral Sciences at USC's Keck School of Medicine, where I was honored with the Della Martin Assistant Professor of Psychiatry endowed professorship in 2019. I maintain a strong research profile with publications in high-impact scientific journals and have extensive clinical experience conducting neurocognitive and psychodiagnostic evaluations across the spectrum of psychiatric illness.
