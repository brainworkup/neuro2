== Reason for Referral
<reason-for-referral>
Biggie Smalls is a 18-year-old, rightright-handed research assistant with :"12 years" years of education, including a
B.A. in Hustling from the University of Bed-Sty. He was referred in order to determine the nature and extent of
neurocognitive sequelae emerging from a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The purpose of the current evaluation is ADHD, anxiety, and depression. This report is based on a review of available
medical records and information gathered across multiple days of evaluation. Treatment planning and plans for test
accommodations were discussed with Biggie during the feedback visit on the final day of the examination.

== Background
<background>
The following information was obtained during an interview with Biggie and from review of available medical records.
Biggie has been doing well in his classes since starting law school and has never failed. However, issues have begun to
arise that he has been unable to avoid, including being easily distracted, restlessness, constantly fidgeting,
procrastination, and variable attention. He suspects having ADHD and has always struggled with aspects of it. Biggie's
mother tried to get his evaluated and tested when he was younger, but was never able to do so because his school at the
time did not agree that there were major concerns. He has noticed increasing difficulty initiating tasks, especially
when it comes to writing long research papers, and has been procrastinating more and more. Biggie has read up on ADHD
and believes he may have it, but has been able to hide it from others, as he has "gotten good at pretending to pay
attention." He seeks further assessment and evaluation to identify any underlying neurocognitive factors influencing his
academic motivations and performance.

== General Cognitive Ability
<sec-iq>
Verbal Comprehension (i.e., the ability to verbalize meaningful concepts, think about verbal information, and express
oneself using words) fell within the High Average and ranked at the 88th percentile. This indicates performance as good
as or better than 88% of same-age peers from the general population.

A subset of intellectual functioning with reduced influences of working memory and processing speed fell within the
Average and ranked at the 61th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 61% of same-age peers
from the general population.

Ethan's score on RBANS Total Index (composite indicator of general cognitive functioning) was Average. Fluid Reasoning
(i.e., the ability to use reasoning to identify and apply solutions to problems) fell within the Average and ranked at
the 42th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 42% of same-age peers from the general
population.

General intellectual ability fell within the Average and ranked at the 39th percentile. This indicates performance as
good as or better than 39% of same-age peers from the general population.

The patient's ability to evaluate visual details understand spatial relations among objects and construct geometric
design using models fell within the Low Average and ranked at the 23th percentile. This indicates performance as good as
or better than 23% of same-age peers from the general population.

Working memory (i.e., the ability to consciously register maintain and manipulate auditory and visual information) fell
within the Low Average and ranked at the 21th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 21% of
same-age peers from the general population.

General intellectual functioning that minimizes expressive language demands fell within the Low Average and ranked at
the 19th percentile. This indicates performance as good as or better than 19% of same-age peers from the general
population.

= RECOMMENDATIONS
<sec-recs>
== Recommendations for Medical/Healthcare
<recommendations-for-medicalhealthcare>
- Biggie should receive interventions to enhance concentration, manage anxiety, and improve emotional understanding.
  This includes social skills training, psychoeducational interventions for self-image improvement, and monitoring for
  signs of internalization or externalization of problems.

- #strong[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):] To develop strategies for improving executive functions and addressing
  self-esteem issues.

- #strong[Occupational Therapy:] To enhance graphomotor skills for academic tasks and daily activities.

- #strong[Cognitive Training:] Techniques to boost working memory and attention, along with strategies to improve focus.

- #strong[Speech-Language Therapy:] Working with a speech-language pathologist can help improve memory skills,
  particularly for verbal material.

- #strong[Psychoeducation:] To empower Biggie with self-awareness and enable his to advocate for his needs in various
  settings.

- Additional support is recommended in areas like attentional function, processing speed, and cognitive efficiency. This
  can be achieved through occupational therapy, the use of organizational tools, and creating a distraction-free
  environment.

- Treatment options for ADHD should include behavioral techniques, stimulant medication consideration, environmental
  organization, and long-term perspective maintenance. Medical treatment discussion with a child and adolescent
  psychiatrist could be beneficial.

- Additional support is suggested in areas like auditory comprehension and complex figure copying. This can be
  accomplished through speech-language pathology and occupational therapy respectively. Use of visual aids and breaking
  down complex tasks into smaller steps can also be helpful.

== Recommendations for School
<recommendations-for-school>
- #strong[Accommodated Testing:] Extended time accommodations are recommended due to relative weakness in processing
  speed and academic fluency.

- #strong[Calculator Use:] Please consider allowing Biggie to utilize a calculator for class assignments and
  examinations as he progresses in the mathematics curriculum.

- Biggie should receive additional support in mathematics through:

  - Individual or small group tutoring.
  - Visual aids and hands-on activities.
  - Technology-based learning tools.
  - Real-life math scenarios practice.
  - Extra time for math-related tasks.

- Support within the educational setting, such as an individualized education plan (IEP) or 504 Plan, to address
  attentional/executive challenges. Academic accommodations should include extended time on tests, reduced copying from
  the board, or a note-taker to offset slower psychomotor speed and attentional challenges.

- #strong[Adaptive Writing Tools:] Use of ergonomic pens or pencil grips for better control and fewer errors.

- #strong[Graphomotor Exercises:] Drawing or tracing exercises for improved fine motor coordination.

- #strong[Extra Time for Written Tasks:] Additional time for tasks requiring writing to compensate for slower
  graphomotor speed.

- #strong[Technology Use:] Keyboard or voice-to-text software use to mitigate graphomotor weaknesses' effect on academic
  performance.

- Tutoring or teaching assistance is recommended for improving his sentence level writing fluency and overall academic
  fluency in reading, math, and writing.

- A supportive environment at home and school involving clear instructions, task breakdown into smaller steps, and
  praise for efforts and achievements.

== Recommendations for Home
<recommendations-for-home>
- #strong[Mnemonic Devices:] Use of mnemonic strategies like acronyms or visual images for memory retention.

- #strong[Organizational Strategies:] Note-taking, list-making, and visual schedules can provide external memory
  support.

- #strong[Task Simplification:] Break down complex information into smaller, manageable parts for effective processing
  and remembering.

- #strong[Repeated Exposure and Practice:] Repeated exposure to material and additional practice are beneficial due to
  below-average learning efficiency.

- #strong[Set Reminders:] Use calendars, alarms, written notes, and lists for task reminders.

- #strong[Mindfulness Training:] Technique to ignore distracting thoughts and concentrate on the task at hand, aiding in
  cognitive control.

== Recommendations for Follow-Up Evaluation
<recommendations-for-follow-up-evaluation>
- A follow-up assessment in 12-18 months is suggested to measure progress and assess the interventions' impact, unless
  urgent concerns arise. Continuous monitoring and reassessment are vital to adjust support as Biggie develops and his
  needs change.

It was a pleasure to work with Mr. Smalls. I am available to provide further information or clarification as needed.

Sincerely,

Thank you for considering this report in your evaluation of Mr. Smalls. I am available to provide further information or
clarification as needed.

== Test Selection Procedures
<test-selection-procedures>
Neuropsychological tests are performance-based, and cognitive performance is summarized above. Cultural considerations
were made in selecting measures, interpreting results, and making diagnostic impressions and recommendations. Test
scores are reported in comparison to same-age and sex/gender peers, with labels (e.g., Below Average, Average, Above
Average; (Guilmette et al., 2020)), intended to be descriptive, not diagnostic. Standardized scores provide important
context, but do not alone lead to accurate diagnosis or treatment recommendations.
