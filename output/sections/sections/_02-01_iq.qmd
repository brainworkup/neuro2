        [#emph[_Premorbid Ability_] is an estimate of an individual's intellectual functioning prior to known or suspected onset of brain disease or dysfunction. Neurocognition is independent of intelligence and evaluates cognitive functioning across five domains\: Attention (focus, concentration, and information processing), Language (verbal communication, naming, comprehension, and fluency), Memory (immediate and delayed verbal and visual recall), Spatial (visuospatial perception, construction, and orientation), and Executive Functions (planning, problem-solving, and mental flexibility). #footnote[All scores in these figures have been standardized as z-scores. In this system: A z-score of 0.0 represents average performance; Each unit represents one standard deviation from the average; Scores between -1.0 and +1.0 fall within the normal range; Scores below -1.0 indicate below-average performance and warrant attention; and Scores at or below -2.0 indicate significantly impaired performance and are clinically concerning.]
