Testing of visual perception/construction revealed overall average performance (mean percentile = 50).

</summary>
Inductive reasoning and nonverbal problem-solving fell within the High Average and ranked at the 84th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 84% of same-age peers from the general population.
Perceptual processing, discrimination, and pattern matching of a series of abstract images requiring close attention to visual detail was High Average.
Understanding visual-spatial relationships to construct unfamiliar geometric designs from a model fell within the High Average and ranked at the 75th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 75% of same-age peers from the general population.
General sequential (deductive) reasoning and quantitative reasoning fell within the Average and ranked at the 37th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 37% of same-age peers from the general population.
Constructing and recreating abstract visual designs (tangrams) from a model using flat polygons (tans) to reproduce each stimulus fell in the Low Average range.
Copying of a complex figure requiring visuospatial integration, planning and organization, and efficient encoding of visuospatial material was Below Average.
