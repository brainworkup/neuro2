Testing of attention/executive revealed overall average performance (mean percentile = 53).

</summary>
Total number of repetitive response errors was High Average.
Performance on a complex measure of divided attention, information processing speed, and inhibition was High Average.
Working memory for orally presented information was High Average (6 digits backward).
Total number of intrusive response errors was High Average.
A measure of both attentional capacity and working memory fell within the Average range.
The patient's ability to encode, maintain, and recall visual information in short-term working memory fell within the Average and ranked at the 63th percentile, indicating performance as good as or better than 63% of same-age peers from the general population.
